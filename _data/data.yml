    intro: >
      Here are some projects I made during my academic path.

    assignments:
      - title: Global Gene Expression Analysis: Determine Hormone Signaling Activation in Human Breast Cancer Samples
        link: "https://github.com/sinitame/epfl-breast-cancer-ml-project"
        tagline: "This project was part of the Machine Learning course @EPFL and was performed with PhD students @EPFL Brisken lab. The goal was to be able to cluster patients according to some gene activations specific to their receptivity to some hormones. Best semestre project Award."

      - title: Epileptic Seizure Prediction on iEEGs Signals Using Machine Learning
        link: "https://github.com/sinitame/ieeg-ml-project"
        tagline: "This project was a semester project supervised by Reza Ranjandish @EPFL Microelectronic System Laboratory. The aim of this project was to explore ML algorithms to detect epileptic seizure using iEEG recordings in order to integrate them in a brain implantable device developed at the laboratory."

      - title: Exploring French National Trafic Injuries Data
        link: "https://epfl-ada-project.github.io/"
        tagline: "This project was part of the Applied Data Analysis course @EPFL. The goal was to explore 10 years of data from the national traffic injuries dataset in France provided by ONSIR and to extract meaningful insights."

      - title: Compression of CNN for Embedded devices
        link: "#"
        tagline: "The goal of this project was to perform a study of state of the art technics to compress neural networks in order to make them more efficient on low constrained devices. I made this project @GrenobleINP TIMA laboratory on the supervision of Stephane Mancini."
